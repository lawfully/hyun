title: What I did until now

When I decided to make this homepage, I didn't think of anything *but* this set of software, [Ed.](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/) on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). The only thing I wondered was **Where?** because although I like [github](https://github.com/) a lot, it wouldn't accept my obsession with [jekyll scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar), which also I like a lot. These days, you can use them as long as it's not on the user page but a project page, I learned. Still, I hesitated, because this containerization thing sort of made me pause. Think about it: that you're running a server to do just one thing -- publishing this site, or turning it into a static site -- for a period of 1 second or so, and then kill it. That looks wasteful, of a life or a life of a software or whatever. Poor server, to live such a short life and be gone... I weep for you. Further, I'm running `jekyll serve` all the time while writing for this site, meaning the static site was already made. So, why don't I just `rsync` it or something. That was my hesitation number 1. After trying it, I didn't like less because, well, it's over even before you know it. Maybe it's github's way of educating users.

`DNS` is checking correctly now, but `https` is not working yet. Wait a couple more days?
