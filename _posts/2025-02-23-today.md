This thing is quickly becoming weekend hobbies. It's rather tricky to exactly regenerate what I did before, even after 1-2 days later. I want 2 websites, on the same software and server, but it fails second time. Something related to the github actions. OK, I succeeded solving the github actions problem.

On the other hand, on `https` issue, the other site succeeded at once, no problem at all. On the other hand, this site... Problem is, on those domain settings the feedback is too long, like 1--2 hours. I removed all those `TXT` and `CNAME` things seemingly related to the legacy `google domain` thing. Hope it works. Let's wait and see a couple more hours.
