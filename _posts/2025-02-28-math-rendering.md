Yes, one of the problems of living with open source software is when you want to do something, there're too many options. Too many.

To render math, I installed [jekyll-katex](https://github.com/linjer/jekyll-katex), then found out about [JekTeX](https://github.com/yagarea/jektex), both are based on [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX). So, what the heck.

What I wanted was to use $$\LaTeX$$. Anyway, it's lovely. Let's try to push it to [github](https://github.com)... It worked.

And, below is for [jektex](https://github.com/yagarea/jektex), $$\jektex$$: 

>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur $$e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)$$ adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

OK, let's just settle with $$\jektex$$.
