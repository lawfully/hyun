My wife wants me to be her editor *cum* website/shopping mall manager. When it comes down to what wife says, I don't really have a way to say no; "well..." is the best I can mutter. Plus, after I began using the AI/LLM or whatever it is, it's not like I'm super busy. Finally, I'm not bad at both. I can handle $$\LaTeX$$ and `pandoc` and stuff pretty well, understand the networking--I mean computer sort, not mingling with people for no reason whatsoever--and, yes, I should be honest here, I like those things.

And, I have a sort of *fear of missing out,* not exactly financially, but I'm worried by not doing the leadership and marketing things, I'm missing out my experience of being a human-sort of way. And, as I said earlier, who can say no to your wife? That's an *existential* question.

So, I chatted with the AI yesterday, who was very helpful figuring out what [shopify](https://shopify.com), [beehiiv](https://beehiiv.com) and [substack](https://substack.com) means and what to do about them. It's gonna be a long weekend.
