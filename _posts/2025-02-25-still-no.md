title: It used to work

Still no `https`. And, no updates, sadly. When you say, it used to work, it's generally a lie. Computers are not random, probably except for github. Yes, I'm getting angry. For some reason, I came to believe that this github action works only after 10AM, and doesn't work before, too early in the morning. Doesn't make sense.

What made me stop and ponder was, even after removing the custom domain, yes, to add it again later, I cannot check the `enforce https` button, with the message,

>â€” Required for your site because you are using the default domain (\*\*\*\*.github.io)

It's really annoying!

For some unknown strange reason, it works on this domain that I also own.
