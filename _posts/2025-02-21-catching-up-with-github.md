Wow, I pretty messed up things. Back to ground zero. This happened because I sort of messed up with `git remote` thing. So, doing all over again those things I did before. So, what happened?

My original intention was to use the `user gh pages.` There was a warning about it at Ed. documentation, but since it -- looked -- aged, not up-to-date, I needed to try it. I did experiment several things, including creating and committing to `gh-pages` branch. Only after seeing the log, I realized that it was because of the jekyll scholar, which I apparently can't live without. So, I changed tactics and created a `project gh pages`. I don't know the difference between them but I sort of like learning by doing, if you know what I mean. Because after sort of successfully deploying on a `project gh pages`, I completely forgot about the `user gh pages`. So, the mess up. I did change one or two things after successfully changing to the `project` pages from `user` pages, I sort of forgot about `git` configurations, like there must be several `remotes` and all, and that there must be some remote changes, because of the `github actions`, the push was rejected until I pull things, and that kind of undo my small updates here and there. Happens all the time, right? I need to experiment, you know.

Mistake happens. We all make mistakes. No worries. Just small things to adjust. Nothing I should despair over. 
No end of the world around the corner.

I'm glad after 13 years, according to github, and despite changes big and small here and there, I could still pull it off. It's rapidly becoming a weekend hobby of sorts, I'm afraid. I should spend more time outdoor.

So, here's what I did, so that I don't forget -- or rather, so that I don't have to remember -- until now. 

### What I did

- created `user gh pages` then messed up because of the `jekyll scholar`
- created `project gh pages` and succeeded
- updated and streamlined `ssh login`
- cleaned up `Ed.` configurations and defaults

### What I will do

- connect domain: doing all [what github says about custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), and get some error. Not sure if it's going to resolve or not. **Update:** It did resolve, but no `https` yet. Wait more?
- some nice fonts: included *Noto* Korean fonts and *Wittgensten,* both variable fonts from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
