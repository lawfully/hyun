title: It used to work

Still no `https`. And, no updates, sadly. When you say, it used to work, it's generally a lie. Computers are not random, probably except for github. Yes, I'm getting angry. For some reason, I came to believe that this github action works only after 10AM, and doesn't work before, too early in the morning. Doesn't make sense.
