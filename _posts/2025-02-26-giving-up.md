Yes, I gave up. When I switched to this domain, it began working in ... less than a minute. What a shame. About the other domain, I just wanted to keep all those `MX` and, possibly `TXT` configurations. `MX` naturally I wanted to keep as I wanted to keep the email configuration, and `TXT` because I thought, "what the heck, it shouldn't matter." It shouldn't, really. After almost 5 days, I made it, but in the process, I forgot what I wanted from this site! Damm.
