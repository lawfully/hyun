title: catching up with github

Wow, I pretty messed up things. Back to ground zero. This happened because I sort of messed up with `git remote` thing. So, doing all over again those things I did before. So, what happened?

My original intention was to use the `user gh pages.` There was a warning about it at Ed. documentation, but since it -- looked -- aged, not up-to-date, I needed to try it. I did experiment several things, including creating and committing to `gh-pages` branch. Only after seeing the log, I realized that it was because of the jekyll scholar, which I apparently can't live without. So, I changed tactics and created a `project gh pages`. I don't know the difference between them but I sort of like learning by doing, if you know what I mean. Because after sort of successfully deploying on a `project gh pages`, I completely forgot about the `user gh pages`. So, the mess up. I did change one or two things after successfully changing to the `project` pages from `user` pages, I sort of forgot about `git` configurations, like there must be several `remotes` and all, and that there must be some remote changes, because of the `github actions`, the push was rejected until I pull things, and that kind of undo my small updates here and there. Happens all the time, right? I need to experiment, you know.
